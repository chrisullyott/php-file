# php-file

A PHP helper for the local filesystem.

There are many functions I wish I had to manage local files, so I made a library for it!

### Installation

Include in your project, or, install with Composer:

```
"require": {
    "chrisullyott/php-file": "dev-master"
},
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/chrisullyott/php-file"
    }
]
```
