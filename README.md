# php-file

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/chrisullyott/php-file/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/chrisullyott/php-file)

A PHP helper for the local filesystem.

There are many functions I wish I had to manage local files, so I made a library for it!

### Installation

With [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
$ composer require chrisullyott/php-file
```
